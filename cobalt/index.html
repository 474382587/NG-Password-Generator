                Canada Cobalt Works Inc. (CCW) is a Canadian-based junior mining enterprise focused on new discoveries
                and cobalt extraction at its past producing Castle mine in the Northern Ontario Cobalt Camp. A team
                with deep roots in the district combined with extensive geological, metallurgical and engineering
                expertise, has allowed Canada Cobalt to become the first company in the region to gain critical
                underground access and produce a premium grade cobalt sulphate product. In addition, CCW is drilling
                aggressively for new discoveries underground at Castle, where Cobalt was historically ignored.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-content">
                Castle Mine was one of the highest-grade silver-cobalt properties in the historic Cobalt Camp in
                Northern Ontario.

            <p class="regular-content">
                Mines in the greater Cobalt Camp (including Gowganda, Cobalt, Silver Centre) produced over 500 million
                oz of silver and over 30 million lbs of cobalt in the 1900s

            <div class="excerpt">
                From the early 1900’s to the late 1980’s, the Castle mine was a major contributor to regional
                production that made Gowganda-Cobalt-Silver Centre in northeastern Ontario one of the richest silver
                mining regions on earth. Documented production exceeded half a billion ounces of silver, propelled by
                extraordinary grades.
            </div>

            <p class="regular-content">The initial silver boom in this metal endowed area in the early 1900’s was so
                spectacular, it outmatched the Klondike Gold Rush in many respects and vaulted Canada into a premier
                position on the world mining stage.</p>
            <p class="regular-content">Silver prices would fluctuate over the decades, surging to an all-time high of
                $50 (U.S.) per troy ounce in 1980.(1) That’s when Agnico Eagle put the Castle and other mines back into
                production in northeastern Ontario.</p>
            <p class="regular-content">
                By the early 1990’s, however, silver was trading at a bottom-feeding $3.58 per troy ounce, (2) and some
                of the mining communities in northeastern Ontario, including Gowganda, Cobalt and Silver Centre,
                quickly turned into ghost towns.</p>
            <p class="regular-content">With silver prices so low, it was impossible to make any money from a silver
                mine, and operations throughout northeastern Ontario, including Castle, were shuttered.</p>
            <div class="emphasize">
                But the mining of silver over a period of about eight decades also included scooping 30 million pounds
                (~14,000 tonnes) of cobalt, demonstrating potential for extraction of this metal in this part of
                Canada. Much of that cobalt was actually used for Canada’s war efforts during the first half of the
                20th century. Beyond that, however, cobalt’s uses at the time were rather limited, and mining it
                presented serious challenges due to low prices and metallurgical issues.

            </div>

            <p class="regular-content">
                Despite their potential to produce large quantities of the now much-needed metal, at much higher than
                average global grades, northeast Ontario’s silver mines and prospective cobalt ground sat idle until
                just recently.
            </p>

            <div class="emphasize">
                Frank Basa looked over the situation more than a decade ago and saw enormous opportunities. He was
                convinced that one day the demand for cobalt would soar, and as a metallurgical specialist he was
                confident he could find a solution to recovery issues.
            </div>

            <p class="regular-content">
                Basa was part of northeast Ontario’s silver mining boom, and the Agnico Eagle team in the 1980’s, and
                he remembered how the cobalt was so evident underground. Yet the miners would show only scant interest
                in the metal – the cobalt “bloom” that was so prevalent was used primarily as an indicator to vector
                toward the highest-grade silver! Cobalt was mostly treated as waste product, and arsenic in the ores
                complicated recoveries for any metals beyond silver.
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize">
                Basa knew the best properties that Agnico Eagle held, and came to the realization that the Castle
                silver mine was actually a “cobalt gold mine”!
            </div>

            <p class="regular-content">
                Castle offered plenty of “cobalt bloom”, where the cobalt is visible to the
                naked eye, and Basa knew that he had to acquire this property and some others. That’s exactly what he
                did.
            </p>
            <p class="regular-content">
                But he needed a market for the cobalt…and that leads us to Reason 2…
